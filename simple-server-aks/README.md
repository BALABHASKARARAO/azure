# Introduction

After my [AWS DynamoDB with Clojure](https://medium.com/@kari.marttila/aws-dynamodb-with-clojure-b4402bf8e8e) project I was planning to deploy the demo application to AWS Fargate and AWS EKS. But I heard that I was assigned to an Azure project next year so I thought that it might be more reasonable to refresh my Azure skills a bit and make one more protocol implementation for the [Clojure Simple Server](https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo/simple-server) - this time for Azure Table Storage.
