# Introduction

This Simple Server Azure AKS project relates to my previous project [Azure Table Storage with Clojure](https://medium.com/@kari.marttila/azure-table-storage-with-clojure-12055e02985c) in which I implemented the Simple Server to use Azure Table Storage as the application database. The Simple Server Azure version is in my Github account: [Clojure Simple Server](https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo/simple-server).

In this new Simple Server Azure AKS project I created a Terraform deployment configuration for the Simple Server Azure version. There is also a Kubernetes deployment configuration in which you can test the Simple Server Docker container both in Minikube and in Azure AKS service.
 
So, the rationale of this project was mainly to learn how to use Terraform with Azure, how to create a Kubernetes deployment and use the Kubernetes deployment configuration with Minikube and Azure AKS. In the next project I create the deployment in the AWS side for EKS and Fargate.
