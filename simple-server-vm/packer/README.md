## NOTE

I originally thought that I'm going to use like **playbook.yml** - I first considered to provision the application using Ansible but then decided to use cloud-init - so, the playbook.yml file is not actually used but I keep it here for historical reasons if I later want to try provisioning the application using Ansible as I now did with cloud-init (see file cloud-init-set-env-mode-single-node.sh).
